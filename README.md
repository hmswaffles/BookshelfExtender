# Bookshelf Extender


Don't know what to read next? Don't know what to get for a bookish friend or a loved-one?

Welcome to Bookshelf Extender, an experimental book recommendation service, currently in the process of being spun-up. By texting a photo of your a bookshelf or book pile to 1 (866) 973-5104, you'll recieve three book recommendations.

There are two ways to start. A) Text a photo of your bookcase or bookpile to 1 (866) 973-5104. For regulatory reasons, there is also option B, which is to text the word "Books" or "BOOKS" to 1 (866) 973-5104. By texting these numbers, you are opt-ing in to recieve messages from the same number. Msg & data rates may apply.

Regulatory compliance requires the following: To opt-out, send "Stop" or "STOP" to the aforementioned phone number

You could also text a stock-photo of a bookshelf to the number if you wanted to test it out!

## Tips
Clear, higher resolution photos generally result in better recommendations. Don't take a photo of your whole bookcase.

## Other Details
BookshelfExtender needs to auto-analyze the photos it is sent in order to make its recommendations. No third parties have access to the photo; nor to any identifiable information.

This service is currently being provided for free.
