# BookshelfExtender

Don't know what to read next? Don't know what to get for a bookish friend or a loved-one?

Welcome to BookshelfExtender, an experimental book recommendation service, currently in the process of being spun-up. By texting a photo of your a bookshelf or book pile to a (soon to be provided) phone number, you'll recieve three book recommendations.
Msg & data rates may apply. 

## Tips
Higher resolution photos generally result in better recommendations. Don't take a photo of your whole bookcase!

## Other Details
BookshelfExtender needs to auto-analyze the photos it is sent in order to make its recommendations. No third parties have access to the photo; nor to any identifiable information.

## This document will be updated in the coming weeks.
