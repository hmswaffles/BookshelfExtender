# BookshelfExtender

Don't know what to read next? Don't know what to get for a bookish friend or a loved-one?

Welcome to BookshelfExtender, an experimental book recommendation service, currently in the process of being spun-up. By texting a photo of your a bookshelf or book pile to a (soon to be provided) phone number, you'll recieve three book recommendations.

There are two ways to get start. A) text the word "Books" to (866) 973-5104 to get started. B) text a photo of your bookcase or bookpile to (866) 973-5104. By texting this number, you are opt-ing in to recieve messages from this number. Msg & data rates may apply.

You could also text a stock-photo of a bookshelf to the number if you wanted. 

## Tips
Higher resolution photos generally result in better recommendations. Don't take a photo of your whole bookcase!

## Other Details
BookshelfExtender needs to auto-analyze the photos it is sent in order to make its recommendations. No third parties have access to the photo; nor to any identifiable information.

BookshelfExtender is a project by Evan Warfel, a former data scientist who is now persuing his Ph.D. in personality psychology. 

## This document will be updated in the coming weeks.
Note that this service will be intermitten until it is completey set up. It is currently being internally tested.
